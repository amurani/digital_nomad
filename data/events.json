      "text": "Introduction \nThe Center for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law (CIPIT) at Strathmore Law School, in partnership with the global pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc. and Novartis International, is holding an innovation workshop and conference from 24th to 26th May2016 at Strathmore University. The East Africa Innovation Workshop follows in the spirit of the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit and seeks to gather key regional stakeholders in a collaborative environment for fostering innovation. \nBackground \nThe East African region is experiencing substantial economic and cultural growth, driven in part by a limitless enthusiasm for innovation. While mobile banking products such as MPesa® showcase African innovation and entrepreneurship on a global scale, innovation is active in virtually all sectors. In health-related products, current research is active in new pharmaceutical compounds, natural formulations, medical devices, and new uses of traditional medicines and bioactive compositions. Such R&D is carried out by universities, international research organizations, and private industry, but in some cases is uncoordinated and lacks guidance with respect to issues of Intellectual Property Rights. \nAbout the workshop \nWorkshop participants will engage with regional experts in exploring the innovative knowledge-based economy in East Africa—and help explore ways to accelerate socio-economic growth, local innovation, and foreign direct investment. The primary focus of the workshop is innovation, and a secondary focus is health care. \nThe workshop leads off on 24th May with a one-day Intellectual Property Boot Camp, ideal for those looking for a more in-depth understanding of IPR, or a refresher in IP and innovation. Participatory panel discussions, research presentations, and interactive breakout sessions take place on 25-26th May. \nThe main themes of the event are: \n\n\nCreating an enabling legal, regulatory and policy environment to unlock the social and economic benefits of  innovation in East Africa; \n\n\nAddressing the intellectual property education and awareness gap in East Africa—and the lack of enabling infrastructure for local innovators, researchers and entrepreneurs; and \n\n\nReviewing the role of innovation in job/wealth creation – especially for African women and the youth, and especially in the area of healthcare. \n\n\n  \nThe boot camp and workshop are free to attend, but registration is required. We look forward to your attendance! \nDetails \nIntellectual Property Rights Boot Camp: 24th May 2016 from 9:00 AM to 4 PM (EAT) \nInnovation Workshop: 25th­–26th May, 2016from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM (EAT) ",

The event has expanded over the years to attract over 50 exhibitors, 120 expert conference speakers and 2,500 delegates in 2015. BFMA gathers senior broadcast executives, producers, advertising agency executives, regulators, academics, regulators and policy-makers, as well as content providers, animators, script-writers, game developers and a host of other creative industry professionals to promote their services, exchange ideas, discuss industry issues and engage in a wide range of networking opportunities. It is an unparalleled industry forum for networking and deal-making across Africa’s dynamic digital media landscape. \nThe event will also include a Forum on the African Diaspora Opportunity for the African Entertainment Industry, highlighting the increasing impact of African entertainment content in international marketplaces. The Forum will explore opportunities for collaboration, distribution deals, joint productions and other channels to grow market presence, impact and revenue. \nFILM INDUSTRY CONFERENCE. \nThe film industry used to be dependent primarily upon theatrical release to distribute content and television was a secondary market. Now with over a billion smart phones and other devices that can play movies, music videos and a host of other media, filmmakers now have more opportunity than ever to deliver their products to a global market. BFMA brings together filmmakers, television executives, independent producers, new media platform entrepreneurs and others involved in delivering media content.

The Forum also serves a necessary function of enabling the Kenyan film industry to keep up to date with international broadcast and film trends and funding strategies. \nAFRICAN ADVERTISING SUMMIT \nEast Africa has never had a conference focused on the advertising industry. BFMA 2015 will introduce such a conference, bringing a critical component into the conversation about how to enhance the quality and profitability of African entertainment content. It adds value to the conference by bringing new relevant media players, introducing new compelling content and stimulating more interaction between broadcasters, content providers and advertisers. Technology and innovation are impacting every aspect of media and this converged environment poses challenges as well as opportunities for the whole media ecosystem. \nGAMING & ANIMATION PAVILLION \nThe Gaming & Animation Pavilion gives Africa’s emerging animators and game developers and startups a place in the expo area to showcase their products in order to attract partners, investors and customers among the extensive international and regional audience attending the event. \nMEDIA TECHNOLOGY EXHIBITION \nMore than 100 international vendors of various types of products and services exhibit at the event.

Are you looking for new strategies of how to sell your ideas and yourself thereby influencing decision makers? \n  \nThen this training is for you! \n  \nAccording Herminia Ibarra, author of Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader, a book published from Harvard Business Review Press, “The problem with authenticity is that if you have an overly-simplistic view of it, you may be hindering your own growth,”  \nFurthermore, there are several studies that reveal a difference between self-perception (how we think we behave or what we think we are good at) and external-perception (how others perceive our actions). If that difference is significant it can generate considerable problems in how we relate to others at the workplace. \nFortunately, there are ways of increasing outsight and evolving toward an “adaptively authentic” way of working & leading, but they require a playful frame of mind.  \n  \nBenefits of this Training \nThis training will help you boost your confidence; strengthen your personal impact & professional relationships. You will: \n1.      Gain an objective perspective on how you interact with others at the workplace & how you sell your ideas & yourself. 2.      Learn how to make value based choices by maintaining strict coherence between what you feel & what you say or do. 3.      Learn how to be true to yourself while increasing outsight and evolving toward an adaptively authentic way of working & leading others. 4.      Get an insight on how to challenge your self-limiting beliefs in order to boost your confidence. 5.      Analyze the perception you have of yourself, how others perceive you and how you respond to others. 6.      Learn how social media has an impact on your career growth.  \n  \nWhat else will we be doing?  Networking after the event from 12pm – 1pm.  Come mingle with other Nairobi business professionals and get a chance to connect with a diverse crowd made up of leaders in different organizations. \n  \nOur Trainer for this program:             \n  \nCaroline Ngina – Professional Personal Branding Trainer \n  \nWho Should Attend This Course \nSenior Management, Managers, anyone who has recently acquired a New Role or a New Job, anyone interested in finding out how to pursue their Career Advancement, and Entrepreneurs. \n  \nCharges: \nAdvance Tickets: Kshs. 4,500/= \nAt the Venue: Kshs. 5,000/= \nPay through Lipa Na Mpesa Till Number 174570 to reserve your spot before the event. There is a 5% discount on Advance Tickets if paid before 1pm 15th April 2016.     \nCharges are inclusive of training materials and high tea. \n  ",

      "text": "\"I would recommend this course to anyone who is doing pharmacy in a developing country, it opens your eyes and you see pharmacy and supply chain from a different angle” (Cynthia Kamtengeni, Zimbabwe, UNICEF) \nWhat is the course about? \nAccording to the constitution of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) access to essential medicines is part of the right to health. Increasing the availability of essential medicines at the service delivery point is crucial to preventing millions of deaths. The success of a health programme is dependent on the ability to reliably and consistently supply essential products, including medicines, to support service delivery. However, despite increased donor funding and an array of new products, there are a number of factors that continue to significantly restrict access to essential medicines and other health products. \nWhile many factors influence medicine availability, the capacity of a country’s supply chain to select, forecast, procure, and deliver essential health supplies can be a major constraint. As we move into the post-2015 agenda of Sustainable Development Goals it is clear that sustainable health supply chain management is critical. \nSupply chain excellence requires that all of the functions of a supply chain work together efficiently. For example, decisions about product selection must inform decisions about distribution modes, the frequency of delivery, and storage specification. Similarly, rational use of pharmaceuticals is critical for accurate quantification - which, in turn, effects procurement planning. Any supply chain strategy must consider these interactions and the associated trade-offs between alternative approaches. \nThe course structure is based on the 6 + 1 rights of a health supply chain: the right goods, the right quantity, the right cost, the right condition, the right place, the right time, and the right interventions. \nPSA's training focuses on the higher–order skills required by supply chain managers to understand the end-to-end requirements for a sustainable health supply chain, rather than a narrow focus on individual activities. It is, therefore, important for everyone involved in supply chain management to have a demonstrable competence in each function. \nWho should attend this course? \nThe training is targeted at people who are responsible for planning, procuring, distributing or monitoring health programme supplies. It will be especially of use to those with a health professional background who are entering the health logistics and supply chain environment. Specific positions may include: \n\nProcurement officers\nPharmacy managers\nWarehouse or distribution managers\nHealth programme managers\nInformation systems managers\nStaff of Central Medical Stores\nTechnical Assistance providers\nDonors supporting commodity programmes\n\nLanguage \nThe course is offered in English. \nCourse Objective \nThe objective of this course is to increase participants' understanding of procurement and logistics management of health supply chains and associated planning requirements, enabling them to make improvements in their own geographical and organisational contexts. \nCourse Learning Outcomes \nBy the conclusion of this course participants will be able to: \n\nunderstand the interrelated components of an end-to-end health supply chain from the perspective of a rights-based approach;\ndescribe the critical cross-cutting elements that need to be in place to ensure a sustainable and well-functioning health supply chain;\nunderstand the issues experienced by supply chain personnel from other countries and organisations, and use these to reflect on their own circumstances; and,\napply the experiences and resources identified in this course to make improvements in their own health supply chain based on their area of influence.\n\nCourse Content \nDay 1:  Module 1 - Introduction \n\nDefine health supply chain management, the key supply chain functions and stakeholders, in the context of the 6 + 1 rights of supply chain\nDescribe the difference between ‘access' to and ‘availability' of essential medicines, and the core elements for access\nDescribe the negative consequences of broken health supply chains\nExplore the key attributes of well-functioning health supply chains\n\nDay 2: Module 2 - Right Interventions, Right Products, Right Quantity \n\nRight Interventions\n\nExplain the ‘umbrella’ of ‘right interventions’, which sets the policy and procedural framework for effective health supply chains\nDefine rational use of medicines and explain how inappropriate use of health commodities affects health supply chains\n\n\n\n\nRight Products\n\nExplain the role of Essential Medicines Lists in product selection, and the benefits of National Essential Medicine Lists (NEMLs) to public health supply chain management\nList the resources available to assist in Medical Devices Needs Assessment before product selection\nDetermine what makes an effective donation policy and consider barriers to effective implementation\n\n\n\n\nRight Quantity\n\nUnderstand what is meant by quantification, and the associated key activities\nApply a variety of quantification methods to determine product quantity requirements\nDescribe how quantification links to subsequent health supply chain management activities\nApply VEN analysis to make the best use of limited financial resources\nExplain how emergency situations may change procurement approaches\n\n\n\nDay 3: Module 3 - Right Quality, Right Cost \n\nRight Quality\n\nDescribe the differences between quality assurance and quality control in a health supply chain context\nList the quality assurance activities used in the procurement cycle, including Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) and pre-qualification\nExplain the differences between counterfeit and sub-standard medicines and what steps can be taken to avoid the entry of these products into the marketplace\nDescribe the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor health supply chain performance\n\n\n\n\nRight Cost\n\nList the guiding principles governing public procurement\nExplore the different procurement activities from requirement definition to supplier performance management\nUnderstand the importance of procurement planning as a key enabler of an integrated health supply chain\n\n\n\nDay 4: Module 4 - Right Place, Right Time \n\nList the components that make up a logistics and inventory management system\nExplore the different logistics and inventory management activities\nDescribe the key elements of cold chain management\nIdentify the key principles to follow to ensure appropriate storage of health commodities\nExplore the common logistics and inventory management challenges in downstream health supply chains\nIdentify when reverse logistics may be required and how this should be operationalised\n\nDay 5: Module 5 - Cross-cutting themes \n\nDescribe the importance of supply chain system design and the concepts of integration (horizontal and internal), segmentation and vertical supply chains\nExplore risk management in health supply chain activities\nExplain the difference between performance monitoring and evaluation activities and identify where these are undertaken throughout the health supply chain cycle\nIdentify key human resources activities that need to be present to ensure a productive and sustainable supply chain workforce\nDescribe how innovation approaches should be considered to ensure appropriate integration into the supply chain\n\nTerms and Conditions \nRead Pamela Steele Associates Ltd. terms and conditions.  ",
